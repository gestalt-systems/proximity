# Proximity

## Motivation

Proximity is an adaption of the principles found in [Mosaic](https://idl.uw.edu/mosaic/) to a React application. It also strongly aligns itself with MotherDuck as the DuckDB server, and Vega-lite as the visualization engine.

## Name

Named for the gestalt principle of 'proximity' which suggests that elements near each other tend to be seen as part of the same object or group.
